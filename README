django-rsscloud
* * * * * * * *

So far, this only contains a django app to plug into your project
and make your RSS 2.0 feed rsscloud enabled (I have just plan to
implement REST interface of rsscloud for the blog-side and the
server-side).

Notice that it's not a complete app yet and it hasn't beed fully
tested (even more: no test has been written yet). Please wait till
I make a complete release.

I'm testing it at my website: http://www.matagus.com.ar/
You can check the RSS feed there.

Any feedback is welcome.
