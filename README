django-rsscloud
===============

django-rsscloud is an application to plug into your django project
and make your RSS 2.0 feed rsscloud enabled. I've only implemented
the REST interface for the blog side.

I'm testing it at my website: http://www.matagus.com.ar/
You can check the RSS feed there.

Any feedback is welcome.
