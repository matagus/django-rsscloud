django-rsscloud
===============

django-rsscloud is an application to plug into your django project
and make your RSS 2.0 feed rsscloud enabled. I've only implemented
the REST interface for the blog side.

It turns your RSS feed into a rsscloud-enabled feed and it allows you
to connect post_save signal from one or more models to a ping function
that will be in charge of pinging the rsscloud server or schedule a
future ping. It also provides a management command to run periodically
in order to ping the rsscloud server if necessary.

I'm testing it at my website: http://www.matagus.com.ar/
You can check the RSS feed there.

Any feedback is welcome.
